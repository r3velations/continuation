# this is a comment in Python

print(2+3)
# this would print 5

mckinney_texas_population = 180000
print(mckinney_texas_population)
# will print 180000
mckinney_texas_population = mckinney_texas_population + 15000
print(mckinney_texas_population)
# will print 195000
# similar to JS where you can take an existing variable and reassign a value
